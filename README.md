# VBA_Challenge-2

## Module 2 | Assignment - Wall Street

1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock by using VBA to decrease the chance of errors and reduce the time to analyze the stock analysis. 

2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

In 2017 https://github.com/Jrobinson3/VBA_Challenge-2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm, most of the stock return was positive except the TERP stock, but in 2018 https://github.com/Jrobinson3/VBA_Challenge-2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm , the most of the stock return was negative except the ENPH and RUN stocks. 

However, the ENPH stock return was decreased from the 2017 return, but the RUN stock return was increased from the 2017 return. 
I would invest in the RUN stock since this stock return continues growing positively in the return analysis.  

The execution times of the original VBS script are less than the execution times of the refactored script https://github.com/Jrobinson3/VBA_Challenge-2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.PNG, https://github.com/Jrobinson3/VBA_Challenge-2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG since some portions (for loops) were not completed so the computer took less time to run the results. 
 
3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1) What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
Per Anarsolutions, https://anarsolutions.com/code-refactoring-concept-analysis/, the advantages of code refactoring are
i) the code is more extensible, meaning many other functions can be added to it. it also helps in increasing the flexibility of the code and with this, the capability of code increases. 
ii) the code is fresher and easier to understand or read, less complex and easier to maintain. 
disadvantages of code factoring are
i) time consuming.
ii) higher chance of mistakes. if the code has an error, it will take more time to solve the problem. there is a stronger chance that the outcome may go wrong due to complexity of the code. 

2) How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Pros: The refactoring VBA script is now working and provides the results, compared to how the previous script did not provide the intended results. This script is easy to understand and read.
Cons: it took a lot of time to complete the correct script. the refactored script was wrong, so it did not provide the results.
